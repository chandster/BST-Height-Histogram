# BST-Height-Histogram

A program to calculate the frequencies of heights of Binary Search Trees with the same elements.

The user enters a positive integer n. For every permutation of the sequence {1,2,..,n} a Binary Search Tree is constructed and its height recorded.

The program outputs a histogram with BST heights from 0 to n and their frequencies. Below it outputs the average height of the BSTs made.

To run the program from the terminal:
```
javac BSTHeightHistogram.java  
java BSTHeightHistogram.java
```
